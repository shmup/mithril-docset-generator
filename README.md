### generate a [zeal](https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal)/[dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) docset for [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/)

1. clone this repo
2. run `make`
3. symlink `$PWD/build/Mithril.docset` to wherever your docsets are stored

on my system it's in: `$HOME/.local/share/Zeal/Zeal/docsets/`
